# WinPass11: Auto

[**Join us on Discord**](https://discord.gg/TEFAbz2ZhW)

🔑 [WinPass11](https://github.com/project-winpass11) is a tool for installing Windows 11 on unsupported hardware in a one click installer. Our goal is for the end-user to easily run a single executable and have access to Windows 11 through the dev channel without having to worry about unsupported hardware. This program supports bypassing all of the Windows 11 requirements!

## Installation
* Download the [latest release](https://github.com/project-winpass11/WinPass11.GuidedInstaller/releases).
* Execute the program named: `WinPass11-Auto_{version}.exe`. You should be asked by UAC to run as administrator, if not, re-run as administrator.
